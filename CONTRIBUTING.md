## Contributing

At the moment, the **KivyMDBuilder** project is not at the stage to make its
source code publicly available. This means that the code is constantly changing
and there is no point in making it public yet. But if you have any desire to
help in the development of this project, you should know some of the features
of this project:

## Project details

- The project architecture uses the MVÐ¡ template - [for detail](https://github.com/HeaTTheatR/LoginAppMVC)
- The project is modular. No part of the project depends on its components
- You don't need to care about the user interface (this is the task of core developer of this project)

## How can I help?

At the moment, there are a number of tasks that need to be addressed:

- Integration of Firebase into the project:

- Integration of AdMob services or their analogues


- Minimum functionality for working with `Git`:
  
    `GiHub` authorization
  
    Creation of a password for subsequent logins
  
    `Pull` project
  
    `Push` project
  
    `View` changes
  
     ...


- Python console
